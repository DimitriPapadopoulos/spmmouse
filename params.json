This project attempts to maintain SPMMouse sources so that they keep working with newer versions of Matlab.\r\n\r\nSPMMouse has been written for [SPM5](http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/software/spm5/). This version requires a recent release of it from the [SPM5 ongoing maintenance project](http://neurospin.github.io/spm5/). This should not be an issue: if you have landed here, it should be because you need to run SPMMouse under a recent version of Matlab, which in turn requires this new version of SPM5.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
